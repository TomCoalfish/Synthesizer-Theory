# Sample
* A sample is an impulse
* a single blip that is usually moving at some high speed
* when they are added up you see shapes in time like square wave
* the wave is sampled into the blips
* the blips are just a number that encode the pulse
* the pulse code modulation is an encoding to turn samples into wave with a dac
* adc turn waves into samples
